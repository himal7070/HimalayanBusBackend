# Here the instructions define your application as a service called "app".
# This service is built from the Dockerfile in the current directory.
# You can add other services your application may depend on here, such as a
# database or a cache. For examples, see the Awesome Compose repository:
# https://github.com/docker/awesome-compose

services:
  mysql:
    image: mysql:8.0
    command: --default-authentication-plugin=mysql_native_password #  authentication plugin
    container_name: mysqldb
    restart: always
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: "helloworld"
      MYSQL_DATABASE: 'bus'
    volumes:
      - mysql-data:/var/lib/mysql
    ports:
      - "3306:3306"

      - "8080:8080"
    environment:
      SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL: jdbc:mysql://mysql:3306/bus #  datasource URL 'mysql'
      SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME: "root"

    # If your application exposes a port, uncomment the following lines and change
    # the port numbers as needed. The first number is the host port and the second
    # is the port inside the container.
    # ports:
    #   - 8080:8080

    # The commented out section below is an example of how to define a PostgreSQL
    # database that your application can use. `depends_on` tells Docker Compose to
    # start the database before your application. The `db-data` volume persists the
    # database data between container restarts. The `db-password` secret is used
    # to set the database password. You must create `db/password.txt` and add
    # a password of your choosing to it before running `docker compose up`.
    #     depends_on:
    #       db:
    #         condition: service_healthy
    #   db:
    #     image: postgres
    #     restart: always
    #     user: postgres
    #     secrets:
    #       - db-password
    #     volumes:
    #       - db-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    #     environment:
    #       - POSTGRES_DB=example
    #       - POSTGRES_PASSWORD_FILE=/run/secrets/db-password
    #     expose:
    #       - 5432
    #     healthcheck:
    #       test: [ "CMD", "pg_isready" ]
    #       interval: 10s
    #       timeout: 5s
    #       retries: 5
